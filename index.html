### Welcome to the plugins repository for Archi
This site has been created to keep track of all plugins that have been created for Archi. No need to be feature full to be listed here. The goal is to provide food for those who wants to try new features or who needs inspiration or help to start creating their own extension.

We will also provide hosting if plugin existing in tarball only.

Don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/archi-contribs/archi-contribs.github.io/issues/new) if you want us to reference or host your plugin.

Here is a list of current plugins:

* [Archi Eclipse Update Site](https://github.com/archi-contribs/eclipse-update-site)
* [ArchiGITPlugin](https://github.com/archi-contribs/ArchiGITPlugin) is a plugin for Archi that allows models to be versioned to a GIT repository. It has some limitation (ArchiMate only, no Canvas and images support) and doesn't work with Archi v3.x.
